# Correlated Bernoulli Random Walk Simulation and Evolutionary Strategy

This project implements a 1-D random walk driven by correlated Bernoulli trials and extends it with an evolutionary strategy for optimizing coordinates in a 2D space. The simulation generates and analyzes the distribution of counters after a random walk process influenced by two Bernoulli variables. The results are visualized using heatmaps to show the relationship between the two counters. This project also includes an evolutionary strategy to minimize the Manhattan distance using counters derived from the Bernoulli random walk as mutations.

## Overview

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Correlated Bernoulli Random Walk Simulation**: 
   - Generates two correlated Bernoulli variables and performs a 1-D random walk, tracking the progress with counters `c1` and `c2`.
   - Visualizes the distribution of these counters using heatmaps.

2. **Evolutionary Strategy**:
   - Implements a (μ, λ) evolutionary strategy to optimize coordinates `x1` and `x2` by minimizing their Manhattan distance to the origin `(0, 0)`.
   - Utilizes the counters `c1` and `c2` generated by the Bernoulli random walk as mutations in the optimization process.

## Correlated Bernoulli Random Walk Simulation

### Simulation Steps

1. **Generation of Correlated Bernoulli Variables**:
   - Two correlated Bernoulli variables, `X1` and `X2`, are generated using specified probabilities `p1` and `p2` and a correlation coefficient `rho`.

2. **1-D Random Walk**:
   - For each Bernoulli variable, a random walk is performed until the first success (i.e., when the variable equals 1) is observed. The counters `c1` and `c2` track the progress of the random walk.

3. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - After multiple repetitions, the final values of the counters `c1` and `c2` are analyzed and visualized using heatmaps to understand their distribution.

### How to Set Parameters

#### `p1` and `p2`

- `p1`: Probability of success (i.e., the Bernoulli variable equals 1) for the first Bernoulli variable `X1`.
- `p2`: Probability of success for the second Bernoulli variable `X2`.

These probabilities determine how likely it is for each variable to trigger a success during the random walk. Both `p1` and `p2` are values between 0 and 1.

#### `rho`

- `rho`: The correlation coefficient between `X1` and `X2`.

This parameter determines the degree of correlation between the two Bernoulli variables.

### Example Usage

To run a simulation with:
- `p1 = 0.8`
- `p2 = 0.8`
- `rho = 0.0`

Set the parameters in the script as follows:

```python
# Parameters
N = 1000  # Number of samples
p1 = 0.8  # Probability of success for the first Bernoulli variable
p2 = 0.8  # Probability of success for the second Bernoulli variable
rho = 0.0 # Correlation coefficient between X1 and X2
